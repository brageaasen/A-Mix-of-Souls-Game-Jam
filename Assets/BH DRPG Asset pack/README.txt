DRPG Asset Pack by Brendan Hesse
Please Credit: Brendan Hesse

"Full resolution" includes all assets at their original high-res illustrations.
"RPG Maker assets" includes all assets formatted and resized to work in RPG Maker MV (and likely MZ, but I haven't tested). To use in your RPG Maker project, 
copy the images to the correct folder in your RPG Maker project folder.

Feel free to reach out if you use this pack! I'd love to see what you make.
