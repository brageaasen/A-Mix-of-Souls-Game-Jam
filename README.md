# Game Jam Solo Project: [A Mix of Souls]

# Description
This short game was created in just one week [for a game jam during the easter of 2023](https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2023), and I'm excited to share it with you.
In [A Mix of Souls], you'll have to collect wrongly sorted angles who have arrived at the gates of hell (the theme of the jam was *duality*)
The game had to follow the retro style of 19'th century dungeon crawler games.
